# Chess
Making a chess engine in VS code.
Ideas for the game
1. Use HTML for graphics (Maybe, looking for better ideas on this)
  - Using Javascript will also be a nice idea, or a bit of both might work much better
3. Use java for main code
4. Implement a machine learning so engine can progressively grow in Python
5. Use SQL for database
